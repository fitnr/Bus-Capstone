## Demonstration notebooks
These notebooks do not require Spark/distributed computing platform.  Although processing time may be long for large samples, everything can run on a typical home computer using a Python distribution and other open-sources packages from [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) such as *pandas* and *scipy*.

### Exploration and Data Quality Analysis

1. [Explore density of sample from DOT](dot_sample_exploration.ipynb)
2. [Extract one day's schedule from GTFS](example_day_schedule.ipynb)
3. [Trip coverage over one day](trip_coverage_20151101.ipynb)

### Example analyses using processed data

1. [Distribution of Travel Time Adherence](travel_time_distributions.ipynb)
2. [Distribution of speeds along shape](plot_speeds_along_shape.ipynb)
3. [Compare number of estimated arrivals to schedule](trip_and_stop_coverage.ipynb)
4. [Calculate common performance metrics](common_metrics.ipynb)
5. [Wait Assessment trend along route](wait_assessment_trend.ipynb)
6. [Visualize performance measurement as a map](visualize_sample_performance.ipynb)
